This time, our group is changing the port given by teachers at the beginning to our own port, and deploy it using the aws server. This will make the website truly available to users beside me and my teammember, while make sure the security of the website. As a group, we changed the set up, the port, and add our own port to important files such as docker. We also add our website to the nighthawk aws server.

    "\n",
    "1. **API Layer:** A Flask-based API to manage comment creation and retrieval. \n",
    "   - **POST /api/comment:** Accepts and validates user input, then stores it in the database.\n",
    "   - **GET /api/comment:** Retrieves all comments in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backend and Database Integration:** I created a table model for the comments to store them persistently. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Frontend:** A JavaScript function to call the API and display comments dynamically.\n",

    "- Add clear error messages in the API responses. \n",
