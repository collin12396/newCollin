    "## About this project and its purpose\n",
    "For this project, our group has built a collaborative website centered around travel. Each team member contributes a unique feature, working together to create a fully integrated platform where users can explore, share, and interact with travel-related content. These features are connected through both frontend and backend development, providing a seamless experience for visitors. The ultimate goal is to help users find the ideal travel destination by offering a dynamic, interactive, and informative website.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose of my feature:\n",
    "My contribution to the project is the Comment Model. This feature enables users to leave comments on the website, allowing them to share their thoughts, experiences, and recommendations with others. The comment system fosters communication among users, encouraging discussions about travel topics. Importantly, all comments are stored in a database, ensuring that they are persistent across sessions. When users return to the website, they can see previous comments, creating an ongoing conversation. This feature enhances user engagement and provides valuable insights for both visitors and content creators."

    "**Initial Approach Without Proper Methods:**\n",
    "I focused on getting the feature functional without using the proper backend approach, such as relying on JavaScript instead of the provided Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I Fixed It:** I explored resource files, like user.py, to find useful code examples and applied them correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Complex Code Structures:**\n",
    "I struggled to comprehend how certain parts of the code functioned and fit together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement:** I reviewed resource files to learn which code blocks correspond to specific situations and used external tools like Copilot to refine and debug my code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Execution Issues Due to Missing Settings:**\n",
    "My code often failed due to missing key configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How I Fixed It:** I checked if I was in the correct environment or the right branch before running the code, ensuring all settings were correctly applied."

The Comment class includes an id as the primary key and a comment field for text storage. The create method handles saving a new comment to the database using SQLAlchemy, with error handling for duplicate or invalid data using IntegrityError. The initComments() function initializes the database by inserting example comments (\"I like to travel around the world\" and \"I usually travel in Asian countries\"). This setup allows comment data to persist even if the server stops, ensuring all comments are accessible when the server restarts.  \n",

    "- This is my backend api that communicate with the frontend that allows to comment and save in the backend. This code enables the backend for the comment function by defining two key operations using Flask. The post method in _CRUD allows users to submit new comments, which are validated to ensure they are not empty before being stored in the database. The get method in _BULK_CRUD retrieves all existing comments from the database and returns them as a JSON list. These functionalities are accessible through the /api/comment endpoint, making it possible for the frontend to interact with the backend to save and display comments dynamically.\n"
