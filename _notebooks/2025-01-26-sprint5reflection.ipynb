    "- I gained experience designing a database table to store and organize comments, making it easy to retrieve and display data on the frontend.\n",

    "- I learned how to configure and run multiple project files, ensuring smooth communication between the backend, database, and frontend.\n",

    "\n",
    "**How I Fixed It:** I explored resource files, like user.py, to find useful code examples and applied them correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Complex Code Structures:**\n",
    "I struggled to comprehend how certain parts of the code functioned and fit together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement:** I reviewed resource files to learn which code blocks correspond to specific situations and used external tools like Copilot to refine and debug my code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Execution Issues Due to Missing Settings:**\n",
    "My code often failed due to missing key configurations.\n",

    "  - Created an API endpoint to receive and store comments from the frontend. The API uses POST requests to save comments to the database and GET requests to retrieve them.\n",

    "- **Data Validation**:\n",

    "### Database Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Structure**:\n",
    "  - The data is structured using a **Comment class** with an `id` and `comment` field in an SQLite database. The comments are stored in a table called `'comments'`.\n",
    "  - Each comment is represented by an object, and multiple comment objects are stored in a list (`comments`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Queries to Retrieve and Format Data**:\n",
    "  - The `create()` method adds a comment to the database, commits the transaction, and returns the comment object. If there is an integrity error (e.g., duplicate data), it rolls back the transaction.\n",
    "  - Example query to add comments:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    db.session.add(self)  # Prepares the comment for saving\n",
    "    db.session.commit()  # Commits the changes to the database\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Backup and Recovery**:\n",
    "  - The database is backed up by saving the current state of the comments to the database. In case of errors (like duplicate or bad data), the transaction is rolled back and the session is removed to ensure the integrity of the data.\n",
    "  - Example of handling errors:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    except IntegrityError:\n",
    "        db.session.rollback()  # Rolls back changes on error\n",
    "        return None\n",
    "    ```\n"
